<p>The oven module must be baked so only exposes a bake function.</p>

<p>All the other functions are returned from within the bake function.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Bake creates an instance of a lua module bound to a state. Here we 
are creating the main state that other modules will then bind to.</p>

<p>We call each state an OVEN to fit into the gamecake naming scheme 
then we bake a module in this oven to bind them to the common state.</p>

<p>Think of it as a sub version of require, so require gets the global 
pointer for a module and bake is used to get the a module bound to 
an oven.</p>

<p>By using this bound state we reduce the verbosity of connecting 
modules and sharing state between them.</p>
