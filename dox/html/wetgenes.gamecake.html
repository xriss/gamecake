<div>

<pre><code>oven=require("wetgenes.gamecake.oven").bake(opts)
</code></pre>

<p>The oven module must be baked so only exposes a bake function.</p>

<p>All the other functions are returned from within the bake function.</p>

<pre><code>widgets=require("wetgenes.gamecake.widgets").bake(oven,widgets)
</code></pre>


<p>The widgets value returned will be the same table passed in or a new 
one if you did not. It will be filled with functions/data bound to 
the oven state which you must supply.</p>


<p>A collection of widgets, rendered using gles2 code and controlled 
using the mouse, keyboard or a joystick. EG click fire and move 
left/right to adjust a slider value.</p>

<p>This has undergone a number of rewrites as we try to simplify the 
widget creation and layout process. Eventually we ended up with a 
fixed size system of widget placement so every widget must have a 
known size in advance, however we allow scaling to occur so for 
instance building a 256x256 widget does not mean that it has to be 
displayed at 256x256 it just means it will be square.</p>

<p>The basic layout just lets you place these widgets in other widgets 
as left to right lines. So as long as you get your sizes right you 
can easily place things just using a list and without keeping track 
of the current position.</p>

<p>Other layout options are available, such as absolute positioning for 
full control and we have simple custom skin versions of the buttons 
as well rather than the built in skins.</p>

<p>All value data is handled by data structures that contain ranges and 
resolutions for data allowing the same data to be bound to multiple 
display widgets. For instance the same data can be linked to the 
position of a slider as well as the content of a text display. I 
think the kids call this sort of thing an MVC pattern but that's a 
terribly dull name.</p>

<p>Swanky paint is probably the most advanced used of the widgets so far
but I suspect we will be making a simple text editor in the near 
future. Designed for advanced in game tweaking of text files.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Bake creates an instance of a lua module bound to a state. Here we 
are creating the main state that other modules will then bind to.</p>

<p>We call each state an OVEN to fit into the gamecake naming scheme 
then we bake a module in this oven to bind them to the common state.</p>

<p>Think of it as a sub version of require, so require gets the global 
pointer for a module and bake is used to get the a module bound to 
an oven.</p>

<p>By using this bound state we reduce the verbosity of connecting 
modules and sharing state between them.</p>
