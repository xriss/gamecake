README for CD

  CD (Canvas Draw) is a platform-independent graphics library. It is implemented in several platforms using native graphics libraries: Microsoft Windows (GDI) and X-Windows (XLIB).
  The library contains functions to support both vector and image applications, and the visualization surface can be either a window or a more abstract surface, such as Image, Clipboard, Metafile, PS, and so on.

  Build instructions and usage are available in the CD documentation.

  For complete information, visit CD's web site at http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd
  or access its documentation in the HTML folder.
