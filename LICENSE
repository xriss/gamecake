 The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
 legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
 usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
 mutually exclusive open-source licenses.
 
 This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
 below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
 any of your projects or products.
 
   - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
     to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
     you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
     documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
     is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
     License.
 
     Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
     License version 3, but not version 2.
 
   - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
     later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
     GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
     advertisement clause.
 
 The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
 of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
 file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).
 
 The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
 compatible to the above two licenses.

 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 		       Version 2, June 1991
 
 
  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
 [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
 
 			    Preamble
 
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 
   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
 your libraries, too.
 
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
 
   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 
   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
 the original authors' reputations.
 
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
 free use or not licensed at all.
 
   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
 one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
 the same as in the ordinary license.
 
   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
 analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
 treats it as such.
 
   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
 
   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
 will lead to faster development of free libraries.
 
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 works together with the library.
 
   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
 General Public License rather than by this special one.
 
 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
 General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
 addressed as "you".
 
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 
     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 
     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
 
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)
 
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 
   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 
   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 
   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 
     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)
 
     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 
     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.
 
     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 
   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 
   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 
   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 
 			    NO WARRANTY
 
   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 
 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 
   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 
   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Library General Public License for more details.
 
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
     Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
 
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 
 That's all there is to it!

 If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or
 more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly
 the order listed) before diving into the code.
 
 
 OVERVIEW
 ========
 
 This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
 decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
 method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
 "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
 are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
 exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
 have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
 very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
 remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
 low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
 with various compression settings.
 
 This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
 compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
 processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
 For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
 variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
 the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.
 
 We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
 plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
 perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
 The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
 
 In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
 considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
 for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
 decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
 colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
 library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
 "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
 processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
 inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
 
 The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
 flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
 the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
 REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
 be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
 achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
 
 We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
 No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
 documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.
 
 
 LEGAL ISSUES
 ============
 
 In plain English:
 
 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the IJG code.
 
 In legalese:
 
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 
 
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
 
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
 
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
     CompuServe Incorporated."
 
 
 REFERENCES
 ==========
 
 We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
 understand the innards of the JPEG software.
 
 The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
 	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
 	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
 (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
 applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
 handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
 available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
 a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
 omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
 and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
 and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
 
 A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
 "The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
 M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
 good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
 including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
 code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
 sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
 at a full implementation, you've got one here...
 
 The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
 Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published
 by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
 The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1
 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG
 in existence, and we highly recommend it.
 
 The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a
 paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified
 official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
 it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)
 In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)
 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
 doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of
 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
 shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
 actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1
 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
 Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
 Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
 numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
 
 Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,
 a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG
 currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.
 
 The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
 format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
 1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
 	Literature Department
 	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
 	1778 McCarthy Blvd.
 	Milpitas, CA 95035
 	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
 A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at
 ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text
 version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
 the figures.
 
 The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
 ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
 found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
 IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
 Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or
 from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision
 of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
 Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
 uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available
 from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.
 
 
 ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
 =================
 
 The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
 address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found
 there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived
 as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have
 direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
 help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.
 
 Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only
 ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.
 
 You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from
 the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or
 on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12
 "JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net
 release.
 
 The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of
 general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is
 not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to
 Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
 It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/
 and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers
 archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.

 RELATED SOFTWARE
 ================
 
 Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a
 few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists
 some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to
 obtain them on Internet.
 
 If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
 PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image
 files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of
 other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest
 version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous
 sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
 Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;
 you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.
 
 A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
 is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program
 is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;
 it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it
 is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
 which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)
 
 
 FILE FORMAT WARS
 ================
 
 Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.
 The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a
 concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,
 creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none
 of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to
 exchange compressed files.)
 
 The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format
 has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has
 become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
 We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF
 Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of
 additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely
 supported, unfortunately.
 
 The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
 SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should
 be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical
 advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an
 official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear
 whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto
 standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we
 have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.
 (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)
 
 Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.
 We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,
 one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
 force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't
 use a proprietary file format!
 
 
 TO DO
 =====
 
 The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.
 The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be
 very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary
 smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving
 quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.
 
 In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
 Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file

 ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY
 
 zlib 1.2.8 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
 thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
 (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and
 rfc1952 (gzip format).
 
 All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
 (volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  A usage example
 of the library is given in the file test/example.c which also tests that
 the library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file
 test/minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source
 files in the root directory.
 
 To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
 the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes
 well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use
 one of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use
 make_vms.com.
 
 Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant
 <info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is
 http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to
 verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest
 version and check whether the problem still exists or not.
 
 PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html before asking for help.
 
 Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997
 issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at
 http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/ .
 
 The changes made in version 1.2.8 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
 
 Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .
 
 zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at
 http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/ .
 
 A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmqs@cpan.org> is available
 at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including
 http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/ .
 
 A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is
 available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see
 http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html .
 
 zlib is built into tcl: http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610 .
 
 An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top
 of zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is available in the
 contrib/minizip directory of zlib.
 
 
 Notes for some targets:
 
 - For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt
 
 - For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With
   -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
   compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.
 
 - zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
   when compiled with cc.
 
 - On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
   necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.
 
 - zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
   other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.
 
 - gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.
 
 - For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/

 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 		       Version 2, June 1991
 
  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
 [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
 
 			    Preamble
 
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 
   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
 your libraries, too.
 
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
 
   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 
   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 
   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
 the original authors' reputations.
 
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
 free use or not licensed at all.
 
   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
 one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
 the same as in the ordinary license.
 
   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
 analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
 treats it as such.
 
   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
 
   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
 will lead to faster development of free libraries.
 
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 works together with the library.
 
   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
 General Public License rather than by this special one.
 
 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
 General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
 addressed as "you".
 
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 
     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 
     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
 
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)
 
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 
   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 
   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 
   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 
     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)
 
     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 
     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.
 
     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 
   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 
   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 
   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 
 			    NO WARRANTY
 
   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 
 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 
   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 
   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Library General Public License for more details.
 
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
     Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
 
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 
 That's all there is to it!
