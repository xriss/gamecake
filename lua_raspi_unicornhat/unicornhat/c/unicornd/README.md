Unicorn Hat daemon
=====================

Unicorn Hat daemon is a simple C program that listen on a Unix socket in
`/var/run/unicornd.socket` and accepts command to set the leds of the Unicorn
Hat so that you can run the daemon as root and your programs as normal
user.

It can handle only one connection at a time and
since the socket has `0777` mode every user can connect to the socket.

### Installation
#### Raspbian

`make install` will install the daemon

```
make
sudo make install
sudo service unicorn start
sudo service unicorn stop
```

To set the daemon to start at boot run `sudo update-rc.d unicorn defaults`

#### Arch Linux ARM

`make install-archlinux` will install the daemon

```
make
su
make install-archlinux
systemctl start unicornd
systemctl stop unicornd
```

To set the daemon to start at boot run `systemctl enable unicornd`

### Protocol
The protocol is simple: each command is composed of a code (the command you want
to execute) and its possible arguments.

You need to first connect to the Unix socket and the send a struct that describe
the command.

##### set brightness

```c
struct {
	uint8_t code; // set to 0
	double  val;
};
```

##### set pixel

```c
struct {
	uint8_t code; // set to 1

	pos_t pos;
	col_t col;
};
```

where `pos_t` is a struct like this:

```c
struct {
	uint8_t x;
	uint8_t y;
};
```

and where `col_t` is a struct like this:

```c
struct {
	uint8_t r;
	uint8_t g;
	uint8_t b;
};
```

##### set all pixels

```c
struct {
	uint8_t code; // set to 2

	col_t pixels[64];
};
```

##### show

```c
struct {
	uint8_t code; // set to 3
};
```
