## lua.wetgenes.gamecake.zone.system.items


Generic game objects, IE things that exist in game and can be interacted with 
by the players.

Some times these exist in world, sometimes they exist in bags or inventory etc 
so are not visible world objects.

As such this item *always* exists here and will be moved in and out of world 
objects as necessary.
