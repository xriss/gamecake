The double to string and string to double should be something we can ping pong back and forth without the number changing.

test this is true by building and running str64

	str64 1242352345234532341234 12323456877686785123512351235 1234i12387468712346871263478

Each number given on the command line will be converted back and forth 10 times and printed

each line should be the same
