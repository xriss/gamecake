# A step by step guide

1. Visit https://github.com/new/import
   - Paste `https://github.com/xriss/plated-example` into the URL
   - Create a name for your new repository and click **Begin import**
   - Go to your new repository when it's ready
    
2. Woohoo! You should now have a brand new website.
    - Check your URL - http://username.github.io/new-repo
    - Your website should now work and contain the default plated-example landing page.

3. Enable Github Actions in **General** https://github.com/username/new-repo/settings/actions
    - Under *Actions permissions*, choose **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** and click **Save**
    - Under *Workflow permissions*, choose **Read and write permissions** and click **Save**
    - You can start editing your site and the changes will automatically be published using Github Actions.
  
4. Enable actions under the **Actions** tab https://github.com/username/new-repo/actions
    - Click on the green **Enable Actions on this repository** button

5. Read [the next bit](#run-this-local) if you want to view your site locally before publishing.

# Run this local

You can test and build your website locally in your preferred browser by running the following scripts in the terminal.   
    
```shell

plated/upgrade	
# Run this first to install the node required dependencies.

plated/build
# Run this at least once to build your website.

plated/start
# Leave this running in a separate tab, it should watch and rebuild your new changes.
# Make sure nothing else is using port http://0.0.0.0:8080.


# View your website in a browser at http://0.0.0.0:8080/new-repo
# Make sure your browser is not caching content, otherwise your changes will not show up.


plated/publish
# Run this to push changes to Github.
# Doing this will re-build and update your current website with the new changes.
# Depending on Github, it may take a while for new changes to show up but it shouldn't be too long.

```


The website is generated into /docs from files found in /plated/source.

**If you want to build into a different local directory**  
Adjust ```PLATED_OUTPUT=../docs``` to point somewhere else in plated/settings.


```diff
- DANGER THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY WILL BE DELETED ON BUILD
```


# Adding Plated-Example to an existing repository

Run the following to pull the latest version of Plated-Example into an existing repository

`git pull git@github.com:xriss/plated-example --allow-unrelated-histories`

  - Beware of merge conflicts, where both projects contain the same file.
  - You will probably conflict with this README.md file but this can just be replaced with your own version.
  - Make sure you have ```node_modules``` listed in your .gitignore file.
    


# Scripts

Plated is a node app.

Please make sure node is available and node dependencies have been installed using ```plated/upgrade```.

The following scripts may be run from this project's **root directory**.

```shell

plated/upgrade	
# This will install or upgrade plated to the latest version using npm.
# Run this once for the scripts to work.
# Run this later to upgrade to the latest version.

plated/build
# Run this at least once to build your website.

plated/start
# Leave this running in a separate tab, it should watch and rebuild your new changes.

plated/watch
# Watches plated/source and continuously builds the website when files are changed.
# Optional if ```plated/start``` is running

plated/serv
# Start a simple static server locally.
# Visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/new-repo/ in your browser to view your site.
# Optional if ```plated/start``` is running

plated/publish
# Builds your website and then does a git add/commit/pull/push of all files to Github.
# Run this after if you prefer the traditional git commands.

plated/pull
# Pull the latest changes direct from the plated-example repository.
# Attempts to ignore possible conflicts outside of this plated directory.
# This should pick up small bug fixes in these scripts without breaking anything else.

plated/settings
# This contains settings used by all the other scripts and should not be run directly.

```
