/**
    This macro can be used with character and string literals (in other words,
    @c 'x' or @c "foo") to automatically convert them to wide strings in Unicode
    builds of wxWidgets. This macro simply returns the value passed to it
    without changes in ASCII build. In fact, its definition is:

    @code
    #ifdef UNICODE
    #   define wxT(x)  L##x
    #else // !Unicode
    #   define wxT(x)  x
    #endif
    @endcode

    Note that since wxWidgets 2.9.0 you shouldn't use wxT() anymore in your
    program sources (it was previously required if you wanted to support Unicode).

    @see @ref overview_unicode, wxS()

    @header{wx/chartype.h}
*/
#define wxT(string)

/**
    Compatibility macro which expands to wxT() in wxWidgets 2 only.

    This macro can be used in the code which needs to compile with both
    wxWidgets 2 and 3 versions in places where v2 API requires a Unicode string
    (in Unicode build) and v3 API only accepts a standard narrow
    string as in e.g. wxCmdLineEntryDesc structure objects initializers.

    Example of use:
    @code
    const wxCmdLineEntryDesc cmdLineDesc[] =
    {
        { wxCMD_LINE_SWITCH, wxT_2("q"), wxT_2("quiet"),
          wxT_2("Don't output verbose messages") },
        wxCMD_LINE_DESC_END
    };
    @endcode

    Without @c wxT_2 the code above wouldn't compile with wxWidgets 2, with @c
    wxT instead of it, it wouldn't compile with wxWidgets 3.

    @see wxT()

    @header{wx/chartype.h}

/**
    wxS is macro which can be used with character and string literals (in other words,
    @c 'x' or @c "foo") to either convert them to wide characters or wide strings
    in @c wchar_t-based (UTF-16) builds or keep them unchanged in @c char-based
    (UTF-8) builds.

    Basically this macro produces characters or strings of type wxStringCharType.

    The use of this macro is optional as the translation will always be done at
    run-time even if there is a mismatch between the kind of the literal used
    and the string or character type used in the current build.
    However using it can be beneficial in <b>performance-sensitive code</b> to
    do the conversion at compile-time instead.

    This macro is exactly the same as wxT() and is defined in wxWidgets simply
    because it may be more intuitive for Windows programmers as the standard
    Win32 headers also define it (as well as yet another name for the same
    macro which is _TEXT()).

    Don't confuse this macro with _()!

    Note that since wxWidgets 2.9.0 the use of _T() is discouraged just like
    for wxT() and also that this macro may conflict with identifiers defined in
    standard headers of some compilers (such as Sun CC) so its use should
    really be avoided.
