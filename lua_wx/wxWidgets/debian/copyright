This package was debianized by Ron Lee <ron@debian.org> on

More information about wxWidgets, as well as the source these debs
are produced from can be found at www.wxwidgets.org

Note for Debian users:
======================

Most of the core wxWidgets library is licenced under the wxWindows Library
Licence (included below), however some additional features of the library
may include source licenced under terms which do not include the exception
permitting you to licence binary object code versions of works based on the
Library under terms of your own choice.  At any time and without warning,
newer versions of the Debian binary packages may include such code.

In short, if you plan to licence apps built against these debs under terms
compatible with the GPL or LGPL, then you have nothing to worry about.  If
you wish to release your code under a licence which does not grant all of
the same rights as the LGPL would assert but would be permitted under the
terms of the exception, then you are strongly advised to either check the
licencing terms of all components that these debs (and all future versions
that you use) are built with, or build your own binaries of wxWidgets which
include only such code as is definitely covered by the exception.

You should presume that these debs will fall under the provisions of the
unmodified LGPL unless you can prove otherwise, however this note in no way
alters the actual terms of the authorative licence detailed below, it is
intended to be purely informative of the fact that the Debian binary packages
will be built primarily with features useful to Free Software developers and
may not be suitable "as is" for compiling software for distribution that is
licenced incompatibly with the LGPL.  See /usr/share/common-licenses for
the full text of the LGPL.

Modifications and additions to the Library itself are encouraged to be
placed under the wxWindows Library Licence.  We hope you find it useful.

Preamble
========

The licensing of the wxWindows library is intended to protect the wxWindows
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the wxWindows Licence, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWindows source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWindows library source code in the way
intended.

The wxWindows Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWindows library contains files
under two different licences:

- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
  Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
  terms.

- Most core wxWindows manuals are made available under the "wxWindows
  Free Documentation Licence", which allows you to distribute modified
  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
  manuals.
