                 All about wxWidgets Version Numbers
                 ===================================

1. Where to update the version numbers:

   There are several places in the wxWidgets source tree that
   define the version number for the library.

   The script misc/scripts/inc_release can be used for incrementing the release
   field of the version, i.e. changing 2.8.x to 2.8.x+1 but it does not take
   care of version.bkl and can't be used for changing the other version
   components, this needs to be done manually. It also doesn't update
   version.bkl file which always needs to be updated manually, follow the
   instructions there.

   Here is the list of files that need to be updated:

   build/bakefiles/version.bkl {C:R:A}          [NOT UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY]
   configure.in
   *.spec
   build/osx/wxvers.xcconfig
   docs/changes.txt
   docs/doxygen/Doxyfile_inc (PROJECT_NUMBER)
   docs/doxygen/latexdocstart.inc
   docs/doxygen/mainpages/manual.h (just date)
   docs/msw/install.txt {major release only}
   include/wx/version.h
   include/wx/osx/config_xcode.h
   samples/Info.plist
   samples/docview/Info.plist
   samples/minimal/borland_ide.cpp {major release only}

   Do not forget to rebake everything after updating version.bkl!

2. When to update the version numbers:

   Version should be updated immediately after releasing the previous version
   so that the sources in the repository always correspond to the next release
   and not the past one.
