This is the first version in the new 2.7 development series. Please
notice that this series is called "development" and not "stable"
solely because ABI or API compatibility is not assured between
different 2.7.x series versions.  Rest assured however that these
potentially incompatible changes are made in order to evolve the
toolkit to the next ABI stable release series (2.8.x) and that
normally efforts are made to preserve compilation compatibility, so
often moving to a new development release just requires a full
recompile of the application using wxWidgets.  There are currently no
known issues with the stability of the programs using this version.

There have been many changes since the 2.6 series, please see the
change log file included in the distribution for more details. The
most significant additions to the GUI part of the libraries were:

    - AUI (advanced user interface) library providing dockable
      windows and much more
    - richtext library implementing wxRichTextCtrl
    - New wxComboCtrl and wxOwnerDrawnComboBox controls
    - New wxTreebook book-like control
    - New wxColour/Dir/File/Font/PickerCtrls
    - wxHyperlinkCtrl control


*** About wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a comprehensive open-source, multi-platform C++ GUI
framework, that can be used to build commercial and free
software. First released in 1992 under the name wxWindows, it's
increasingly used by organisations and individuals all over the
world due to its winning combination of sophistication, wide
platform coverage, ease of use, unrestrictive licence and
vibrant user community.

For most ports, wxWidgets adopts the native look and feel of
each platform since it uses the native widget sets. There is also
a generic widget set, used for example by the wxX11 port - no
other widget set is required, giving the potential for embedded
use.

An extraordinary range of classes is provided - but don't be put
off by this because most people find wxWidgets easier to learn
and use than MFC and other frameworks.

As well as comprehensive support for the usual widgets, advanced
features include: HTML viewing/printing, wxImage class providing
handlers for reading and writing many image types, resizable panels
and dialogs on all platforms, document/view, OpenGL support,
HTML-based and context-sensitive help, wizards, drag and drop,
a grid class, ODBC support, threads, sockets, container classes,
a styled text control, and much more. A 2,000-page reference manual
is provided in HTML, MS HTML Help, WinHelp, wxWidgets Help and PDF
formats, and there are over eighty samples and demos.

If you're an MFC user, you'll find many wxWidgets concepts
reassuringly familiar, while often clearer and more consistent.
If you're not, you should still find it intuitive from the start.

wxWidgets bindings for many other languages are available,
including Python, Perl, Basic, Lua, JavaScript and Eiffel.
