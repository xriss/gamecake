.TH wx\-config 1 "29 Sep 2004" "Debian GNU/Linux" "wxWidgets"

.SH NAME
wx-config \- wxWidgets configuration search and query tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nh
.HP
.B wx\-config [ OPTIONS ... ] [ LIB ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I wx\-config
returns information about the wxWidgets libraries available on your system.
It may be used to retrieve the information you require to build applications
using these libraries.
.PP
Changing the library options you wish to use for an application previously
involved managing alternative configurations by a system dependent means.
It is now possible to select from any of the configurations installed
on your system via this single tool.  You can view all available
configurations installed in the system default prefix with the command
.I wx\-config \-\-list
and select from them by using the feature options described below.
.PP
Optional LIB arguments (comma or space separated) may be used to specify
individually the wxWidgets component libraries that you wish to use,
or to specify additional components not ususally included by default.
The magic token
.B std
may be used to import all libraries that would be used by default if none
were specified explicitly.
.br
eg.
.I wx-config --libs std,gizmos
.hy

.SH OPTIONS
.l
\fIwx\-config\fP accepts the following options with no restrictions on
their order as was required in previous releases:

.SS Installed root
These options change or query the filesystem root for the operations
listed below.

.TP 15
.B  \-\-prefix[=PREFIX]
Without the optional argument, the current default prefix will be
output.  If the argument is supplied, PREFIX will be searched for
matching configs in place of the default.  You may use both forms
in the same command.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-exec\-prefix[=EXEC-PREFIX]
Similar to \-\-prefix, but acts on the exec-prefix.  If not specified
will default to the value of prefix.

.SS Query options
These options return information about the wxWidgets default version
and and installed alternatives.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-list
List all configs in prefix and show those that match any additional
feature options given.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-release
Output the wxWidgets release number.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-version\-full
Output the wxWidgets version number in all its glory.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-basename
Output the base name of the wxWidgets libraries.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-selected-config
Output the signature of the selected wxWidgets library.
This is a string of the form "port-unicode-release-version".


.SS Feature options
These options select features which determine which wxWidgets
configuration to use.

.TP 15
.B  \-\-host=HOST
Specify a (posix extended) regex of host aliases to match for cross
compiled configurations.  eg. \-\-host=i586-mingw32msvc, \-\-host=.*
If unspecified, the default is to match only configurations native to
the build machine.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-toolkit=TOOLKIT
Specify a (posix extended) regex of the toolkits to match.
The toolkit is responsible for look and feel of the compiled
application.  eg. gtk, gtk2, motif, msw.
If unspecified the default is to prefer the system default toolkit,
but to match any toolkit in the absence of a stricter specification.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-version[=VERSION]
Without the optional argument, return the wxWidgets version.  If the
argument is supplied it specifies a (posix extended) regex of the
versions to match.  If unspecified the default is to prefer the system
default version, but to match any version in the absence of a stricter
specification.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-unicode[=yes|no]]
Specify the default character type for the application.
If unspecified, the system default will be preferred, but any type may
match in the absence of a stricter specification.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-debug[=yes|no]]
Specify whether to create a debug or release build for the application.
If unspecified, the system default (release) will be preferred, but any
type may match in the absence of a stricter specification.
Debug builds should never be uploaded to Debian, but are very useful
for finding certain common failure idioms.  You are encouraged to use
them during active development of applications.  They are not binary
compatible with the release libraries.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-static[=yes|no]]
Specify whether to statically or dynamically link wxWidgets libraries
into your application.  If unspecified, the system default (dynamic)
will be preferred, but any type may match in the absence of a stricter
specification.  Static linking is mainly useful still for cross ports
not natively supported by Debian, and can be hazardous in conjunction
with the gtk toolkits.  Note that static libraries are no longer supplied
in the wxGTK packages any more.

.SS Compiler options
These options generate output required to build an application using
a particular wxWidgets configuration.

.TP 15
.B  \-\-libs
Output link flags required for a \fIwxWidgets\fP application.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-cppflags
Output parameters required by the C preprocessor.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-cflags
Output parameters required by the C compiler.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-cxxflags
Output parameters required by the C++ compiler.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-cc
Output the name of the C compiler \fB$(CC)\fP.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-cxx
Output the name of the C++ compiler \fB$(CXX)\fP.
.TP 15
.B  \-\-ld
Output the linker command.
