/**
    Provides methods for testing the state of the keyboard modifier keys.

    This class is used as a base class of wxKeyEvent and wxMouseState and,
    hence, indirectly, of wxMouseEvent, so its methods may be used to get
    information about the modifier keys which were pressed when the event
    occurred.

    This class is implemented entirely inline in @<wx/kbdstate.h@> and thus has
    no linking requirements.

class wxKeyboardState
{
public:
    /**
        Constructor initializes the modifier key settings.

        By default, no modifiers are active.
     */
    wxKeyboardState(bool controlDown = false,
                    bool shiftDown = false,
                    bool altDown = false,
                    bool metaDown = false);

    /**
        Return the bit mask of all pressed modifier keys.

        The return value is a combination of @c wxMOD_ALT, @c wxMOD_CONTROL,
        @c wxMOD_SHIFT and @c wxMOD_META bit masks. Additionally, @c wxMOD_NONE
        is defined as 0, i.e. corresponds to no modifiers (see HasModifiers())
        and @c wxMOD_CMD is either @c wxMOD_CONTROL (MSW and Unix) or
        @c wxMOD_META (Mac), see CmdDown().
        See ::wxKeyModifier for the full list of modifiers.

        Notice that this function is easier to use correctly than, for example,
        ControlDown() because when using the latter you also have to remember to
        test that none of the other modifiers is pressed:

        @code
        if ( ControlDown() && !AltDown() && !ShiftDown() && !MetaDown() )
            ... handle Ctrl-XXX ...
        @endcode

        and forgetting to do it can result in serious program bugs (e.g. program
        not working with European keyboard layout where @c AltGr key which is
        seen by the program as combination of CTRL and ALT is used). On the
        other hand, you can simply write:

        @code
        if ( GetModifiers() == wxMOD_CONTROL )
            ... handle Ctrl-XXX ...
        @endcode

        with this function.

        test for the more frequently used Command key (and not the rarely used
        Control one) under Mac.

        instead of ControlDown() because @c Command key is used for the same

        exists, it is usually not used for the same purpose under Mac).
