the gcc build process was pretty much copied from

http://www.cowlark.com/2009-07-04-building-gcc/

which seems to be the only simple example

Broken down into a few batch files so if things go wrong we can try and sort it out.

Run 0... then 1... then 2... etc and you may end up with a working gcc at the end

Why do we need to build GCC? well this builds a crosscompiler for the raspi hardfloat but I suspect we may need other targets soon as well.
